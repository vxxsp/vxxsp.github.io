<p> Hi. This is a scheduled tweet for 10/27/20.</p>
<p> I am so sorry to say, but i don't exist in this world anymore.</p>
<p> That's the easiest way to put it.</p>
<p> I have had so many good and positive friends.
<p> If you haven't noticed yet this world isn't always so good.</p>
<p> Sadly in my life there was more bad than good.</p>
<p> I had 2 moms which divorced when I was young.</p
<p> I never remember them being together.</p>
<p> On top of them being divorced, they hated each other, and I would always end up in the middle.</p>
<p> They would always say how the other parent was bad and how they sucked at parenting.</p>
<p> Through my time on twitter I made good friends.</p>
<p> I got to be a admin in @ParchieRBLX 's discord server, which was so fun and amazing!!</p>
<p> I got to be friends with @PASTELRALNBOW , one of the nicest people ever!!!</p>
<p> @Spiduka and @Axecery were both great friends to have!!</p>
<p> @MikeTheRawkstar was always so chill and positive!!</p>
<p> I was friends with some pretty epic GFX artists like @WhoseTruss and @HeyHyperGFX.</p>
<p> If I hadn't joined twitter I wouldn't have met so many kind and talented people.</p>
<p> Through my time on roblox I made a successful showcase which I am so glad people enjoyed and appreciated!</p>
<p> Never thought I would reach 22k visits!</p>
<p> In my life I created a yt channel with 210 subs lol.</p>
<p> I made some pretty cringe vids on it lol.</p>
<p> Just a couple things before I end the note.</p>
<p> @PASTELRALNBOW and @Nullxiety have a great time together!!</p>
<p> Don't let anyone bring you guys down.</p>
<p> You two are so damn nice and are definitely made for eachother :)</p>
<p> Also good luck Pastel with your yt channel, off of what I saw was pure epicness.</p>
<p> To ALL of the GFX artists out there keep up the great work and do what you love!</p>
<p> Also thank you Pastel for all your support!</p>
<p> I knew you did everything you could do to help <3</p>
<p> While you might see my Roblox account online it's just cause my computer is always open.</p>
<p> I am not going to say what I did, I'll just say hopefully it was painless.</p>
<p> I'm sorry I hate to go.</p>
<p> To everyone out there, just remember to keep doing what you like/love!!!</p>
<p></p>
